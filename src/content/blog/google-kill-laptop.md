I've spent the last few days using my Pixel phone as a desktop computer. Not through some hacky workaround or third-party app, but through Android's built-in hidden desktop mode. You plug in a monitor, connect a keyboard and mouse, and suddenly you're looking at a full windowed desktop environment running on your phone.

And it's surprisingly ready.

## The experience right now

You can drag windows around. You can resize them. You can run multiple apps side by side. The taskbar works. Alt-tab works. It feels less like a phone pretending to be a computer and more like a lightweight Chromebook that happens to live in your pocket.

Is it perfect? No. Some apps don't handle the larger screen well. There are occasional quirks with window management. But the core experience (browsing, writing, managing files, even light development work) is genuinely usable. Not "usable for a phone." Actually usable.

I wasn't expecting that. I plugged it in mostly out of curiosity, expecting a gimmick. What I found was something that felt like a preview of where personal computing is heading.

## Google is already making moves

This isn't just a hidden feature that Google forgot to remove. The signals are everywhere. ChromeOS is transitioning to the Android Linux kernel. Google is actively merging its desktop and mobile operating systems under the hood. At I/O 2025, Google announced support for "connected displays," which is exactly the infrastructure you need to make phone-as-desktop work properly.

The pieces are falling into place. Android is getting desktop window management. ChromeOS is getting Android's kernel. The two platforms are converging, and the phone is going to be the device that sits at the centre.

## The Android Auto comparison

Think about what happened with cars. Ten years ago, every car manufacturer was building their own infotainment system. They were all terrible. Then Android Auto and CarPlay came along, and the phone became the brain of the car. The car's screen became just a display. Nobody cared about the car's built-in software anymore because the phone did everything better.

Laptops are next. Your phone already has more processing power than most people need for daily computing. It already has your accounts, your apps, your data, your authentication. The only thing missing is a comfortable way to use it with a big screen and a real keyboard. Desktop mode is that missing piece.

## The practical case

Think about what this means day to day. You carry one device: your phone. At your desk, you plug into a monitor with a keyboard and mouse and you have a full desktop experience. At a coffee shop, you use the phone as a phone. On the train, same thing. You never need to sync files between devices because there's only one device. You never need to worry about leaving your laptop somewhere because you don't have one.

For most people (people who browse the web, write documents, handle email, manage spreadsheets) this is more than enough. The laptop was already overkill for what they do. The phone just needs to present itself properly on a bigger screen, and desktop mode does exactly that.

## Why Google will push this

Google has every reason to go all in on this. Chromebooks exist, but let's be honest, they're not a status symbol. They're the computer you buy because it's cheap, not because you're excited about it. But a Pixel that's both your phone and your laptop? That's a genuine differentiator. That's a reason to choose Pixel over iPhone.

Samsung has been doing a version of this with DeX for years, but Samsung doesn't control Android the way Google does. Google can bake desktop mode deep into the OS, optimise it across the entire ecosystem, and make it a first-class feature rather than a bolt-on extra.

## Apple won't follow

This is the interesting part. Apple could do this tomorrow. The M-series chips in iPhones are absurdly powerful, and iPadOS already has decent window management. But they won't. Because every iPhone that replaces a MacBook is a MacBook sale lost. Apple's business model depends on you buying multiple devices. The phone, the tablet, the laptop, the desktop: each one is a separate revenue stream.

Google doesn't have that problem. Google makes money from services, not hardware margins. If a Pixel replaces both your phone and your Chromebook, Google still wins because you're still using Google services on a Google OS. They have no reason to protect laptop sales because laptop sales were never the point.

## My prediction

Google will announce phone-as-desktop as a proper, marketed feature at I/O 2026. Not a hidden developer option. Not a beta. A headline feature with optimised apps, accessory partnerships, and a marketing push. "Your Pixel is your computer" or something along those lines.

The laptop isn't going to disappear overnight. Power users, developers, creative professionals: they'll need dedicated hardware for a while yet. But for the majority of people, the phone in their pocket is about to become the only computer they need.

I've seen the future, and it fits in my pocket.
