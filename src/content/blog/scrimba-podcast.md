I recently had the chance to appear on the Scrimba podcast, which felt like a full-circle moment.

## How it happened

I learned web development through Scrimba. When I decided to leave acting and move into software development in 2022, Scrimba was one of the main platforms I used to build my skills. The interactive coding environment, the community, and the structured courses gave me a solid foundation to start building real projects.

When I landed my first developer role and then moved into a lead position, the Scrimba team reached out and asked if I'd come on the podcast to talk about my transition. It was a great conversation about what it's actually like to change careers into tech. The reality of it, not just the highlight reel.

## What we talked about

The episode covers the practical side of making a career switch: how I chose what to learn, how I built a portfolio, how I approached job applications with no commercial experience, and what the first year as a professional developer actually felt like.

We also talked about the skills that carried over from acting (communication, presenting, working under pressure) and how they show up in a development role in ways I didn't expect.

## Listen
